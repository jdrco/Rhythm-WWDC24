## Description

This project is a simple drum machine that utilizes Swift, SwiftUI and AVAudioEngine allowing users to produce their own music!

The application enables users to play preset sounds on a 2x4 drum pad grid and record their compositions in any desired tempo or number of bars. Additionally, they can loop and play back their sounds. The app also includes an interactive tutorial on the basics of rhythm and beat production.
